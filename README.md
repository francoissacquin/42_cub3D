# 42_cub3D

Hello there. This is a graphical project done as part of the 42 school cursus. It is a simple 3D game that simulates a labyrinth through raycasting where the player can freely move and explore. This was done on linux using the 42 minilibX library for graphical projects. Have a nice day. :D
